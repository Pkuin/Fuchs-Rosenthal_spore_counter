# Fuchs-Rosenthal_spore_counter
Small function for calculating the spore concentration when using the Fuchs-Rosenthal hemocytometer.

Trying to make a small interactive application;
Where either counted spores can be converted into spore concentration, 
or how many spores are needed for a certain concentration.
